## United States Geological Suyvey
- Agency that maintains records of earthquakes experienced in US and around the world
- Records and updated every day
- Records between any dates can be accessed using their web-API

## Data Format and Processing
- Records between any dates is obtained in a JSON format
- The JSON is converted into dataframe using `jsonlite` package
- Latitude, Longitude, Depth, Magnitude, Significance
- Significance is a composite score assigned by the database (based on magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, estimated impact)

## Attaching the region names
- Using the location coordinates to infer region names (continents and countries)
- `rworldmap` and `sp` packages to map the coordinates to regions

## Visualizations
- Country and Continent distribution histograms
- Plotting continent-wise earthquakes on interactive world map
- Scatter plots to study the relationship of significance v/s depth and significance v/s intensity

## Examples
- Japan Earthquake (2011) - sigValue = 2160
- Indian Ocean Earthquake (2004) - sigValue = 2080
- Nepal Earthquake - sigValue = 2820
- [The Ring of Fire](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=Ring%20of%20Fire)
