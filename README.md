# USGS EARTHQUAKE DATA ANALYSIS

##Abstract

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains detailed information on earthquakes experience around the world. The information such as location, intensity, time and date of earthquakes experienced around the globe can be accessed through the web-APIs provided by USGS. For this project I intend to build data access and analysis methods in R that can get user-defined earthquake data from USGS and display it in suitable formats.
I will have use the methods in R that process XML/JSON since the data obtained from web-APIs will be in these formats. I will also require the date and time process functions in R to convert the timestamps of earthquakes into easy accessible formats
